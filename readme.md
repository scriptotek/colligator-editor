## colligator-editor

Playing with Vue.js 2 to make a simple interface for interacting with the
Colligator API. Currently supports search and cover editing.

Run `npm run build` to compile ES2015 to ES5.

For now, no module loader is used. The webpack-powered vue-loader looks
great, but I didn't succeed installing it, and the docs doesn't mention Vue 2,
so it might not be ready for it yet.
